        <h1>What is Internet ?</h1>
        
            <p>The internet is a global network that connects computers and devices,</p>
            enabling data sharing and communication using standardized protocols like TCP/IP.
            <p>It powers services like the web, email, and streaming, operating without a central authority.

        <h2>What is TCP/IP ?</h2>
        <P>TCP/IP is a set of protocols that enables devices to communicate over the internet.
        <P>TCP ensures reliable data transfer, while IP handles addressing and routing to get data to the right destination.</P>
        <p><strong>TCP/IP</strong> is like a <EM>postal system</EM> for the internet</p>
        <p><strong>IP</strong> is <em>the address on the envelope,</em> making sure the package (data)</p>
        <p>to the right house (devices)</p>
        <p><strong>TCP</strong> is the <em>delivery</em> service that ensure the package arrives safely</p>
        <p>, complete, and in the right order.</p>
